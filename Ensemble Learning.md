# **Ensemble Learning**

Ensemble learning is a machine learning technique that combines multiple individual models (often referred to as "weak learners") to create a single, stronger predictive model. The core idea is that a group of diverse models working together can achieve better performance than a single model alone.

## **Key Types of Ensemble Methods**

1. **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating):**
   - Multiple models are trained independently on different subsets of the data (created via bootstrapping).
   - Predictions are aggregated (e.g., by averaging for regression or voting for classification).
   - **When to use:** Effective for high-variance models, as it reduces variance
   - **Example:** Random Forest.

2. **Boosting:**
   - Models are trained sequentially, with each model focusing on correcting the errors of its predecessor.
   - Predictions are combined to create a stronger final model.
   - **When to use:** Addresses high-bias problems by iteratively refining predictions.
   - **Example:** Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, XGBoost.

3. **Stacking (Stacked Generalization):**
   - Stacking uses multiple base models (level-0 models) to make predictions, and these predictions serve as input features for a higher-level model (meta-model) to make the final prediction.The meta-model learns how to weigh and combine the predictions of the base models.
   - The base models generate predictions, which serve as input features for the meta-model.
   - **When to use:** Useful for leveraging the strengths of diverse models to improve overall performance.
   - **Example Algorithms:** Can combine diverse models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression with a meta-model like Linear Regression.

4. **Voting:**
   - Combines predictions from multiple models via majority voting (for classification) or averaging (for regression).It does not involve learning; it relies on simple aggregation.
   - **When to use:** When individual models perform well and have similar accuracy, and diversity among models can provide better consensus.
   - **Example Algorithms:** Majority vote among Decision Trees, SVMs, and Logistic Regression.

## **Advantages of Ensemble Learning**

1. **Improved Accuracy:**
   - By combining the strengths of multiple models, ensembles often outperform individual models.

2. **Reduced Overfitting:**
   - Techniques like bagging reduce variance and help prevent overfitting, especially in high-variance models like decision trees.

3. **Increased Robustness:**
   - Ensemble models are less sensitive to errors from individual weak learners, leading to more reliable predictions.

4. **Flexibility:**
   - Can use a variety of models and algorithms together, benefiting from their diverse strengths.

5. **Better Generalization:**
   - Helps to capture complex patterns in data by leveraging the diversity of base models.
