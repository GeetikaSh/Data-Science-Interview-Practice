# **Ensemble Learning**

Ensemble learning is a machine learning technique that combines multiple individual models (often referred to as "weak learners") to create a single, stronger predictive model. The core idea is that a group of diverse models working together can achieve better performance than a single model alone.

## **Key Types of Ensemble Methods**

1. **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating):**
   - Multiple models are trained independently on different subsets of the data (created via bootstrapping).
   - Predictions are aggregated (e.g., by averaging for regression or voting for classification).
   - **Example:** Random Forest.

2. **Boosting:**
   - Models are trained sequentially, with each model focusing on correcting the errors of its predecessor.
   - Predictions are combined to create a stronger final model.
   - **Example:** Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, XGBoost.

3. **Stacking (Stacked Generalization):**
   - Combines the predictions of multiple models using a "meta-model."
   - The base models generate predictions, which serve as input features for the meta-model.

4. **Voting:**
   - Combines predictions from multiple models via majority voting (for classification) or averaging (for regression).

## **Advantages of Ensemble Learning**

1. **Improved Accuracy:**
   - By combining the strengths of multiple models, ensembles often outperform individual models.

2. **Reduced Overfitting:**
   - Techniques like bagging reduce variance and help prevent overfitting, especially in high-variance models like decision trees.

3. **Increased Robustness:**
   - Ensemble models are less sensitive to errors from individual weak learners, leading to more reliable predictions.

4. **Flexibility:**
   - Can use a variety of models and algorithms together, benefiting from their diverse strengths.

5. **Better Generalization:**
   - Helps to capture complex patterns in data by leveraging the diversity of base models.

- Recommendation systems
- Healthcare diagnostics

Ensemble learning is widely used because it balances performance and robustness, making it a preferred choice for many real-world machine learning problems.
