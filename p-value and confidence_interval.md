# Explaining P-Value and Confidence Intervals to Non-Technical Stakeholders

## **1. What is a P-Value?**

A **p-value** helps us determine whether the results of an experiment or analysis are significant or just due to chance.  

Think of it as the **"surprise factor"**:  
- A small p-value (e.g., less than 0.05) means the result is surprising enough that it’s **unlikely due to chance**, so we consider the effect real or significant.  
- A large p-value (e.g., greater than 0.05) means the result is not surprising and could easily have happened by random chance.

### **Analogy:**
Imagine you’re flipping a coin:  
- If you flip it 10 times and get 8 heads, you might think, “That’s odd; maybe the coin is biased.”  
- The p-value helps quantify how unusual or “surprising” this result is compared to what’s expected with a fair coin (50-50 chance).  
If the p-value is very small, you conclude the coin is likely unfair. If it’s large, it’s probably just luck.

### **Interpreting Hypothesis Testing**
A **p-value (probability value)** helps determine whether the results of an experiment are statistically significant. It represents the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme as the observed one, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
- If **p < 0.05** (commonly used threshold), we reject the null hypothesis, meaning there is strong evidence that the observed effect is not due to chance.
- If **p > 0.05**, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, meaning the observed effect could have happened by random chance.

## **2. What is a Confidence Interval?**

A **confidence interval** gives a range of values that we’re fairly sure contains the true result or effect.  

Think of it as a **margin of error**:  
- For example, if we say **"Sales increased by 10% ± 2%"**, the 10% is our best guess, but we’re confident the real increase is between 8% and 12%.  
- A **95% confidence interval** means that if we repeated the analysis many times, the true value would fall within this range **95 out of 100 times**.

### **Analogy:**
Imagine you’re estimating the weight of a suitcase:  
- You say, “It’s about 20 kg, give or take 2 kg.” This range (18-22 kg) is your confidence interval.  
You’re not 100% sure it’s exactly 20 kg, but you’re confident the true weight falls within that range.

## **Key Takeaways**:
- **P-Value**: Tells us if a result is surprising or significant (unlikely due to chance).  
  - *Smaller is better*: p < 0.05 often means the result is significant.  
- **Confidence Interval**: Provides a range of likely values for the result, showing how precise our estimate is.  
  - *Narrower is better*: A tighter range means we’re more confident about the estimate.  

By combining both, we can communicate not only whether a result matters (p-value) but also how reliable our estimate is (confidence interval).
