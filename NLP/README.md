# Natural Language Programming(NLP) Study Plan

# 🧠 Phase 1: Core Foundations
## ✅ Basics
- What is NLP?
- NLP vs Classical ML vs Deep Learning
- Text preprocessing pipeline

## ✅ Text Preprocessing
- _Tokenization (word, sentence)_
- Stopword removal
- Stemming vs Lemmatization
- POS tagging
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Regex for text
  

## ✅ Bag of Words & TF-IDF
- CountVectorizer
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- N-grams

# 🤖 Phase 2: Machine Learning + NLP
Apply classical ML models on text data

## ✅ Text Classification
- Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM
- Sentiment Analysis, Spam Detection

## ✅ Model Evaluation
- Accuracy, F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

# 🔡 Phase 3: Word Embeddings
Move from sparse to dense vector representations

## ✅ Word Embedding Techniques
- Word2Vec (CBOW & Skip-Gram)
- GloVe
- FastText

## ✅ Using Pre-trained Embeddings
- Load with Gensim or TorchText
- Embedding Matrix for Keras or PyTorch

# 📚 Phase 4: Deep Learning for NLP
Start applying Neural Networks

## ✅ RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs
- Sequence modeling
- Language modeling
- Text generation

## ✅ Use Libraries like:
- Keras (with Embedding + LSTM layers)
- PyTorch (with Embedding + RNN modules)

# 🧠 Phase 5: Transformers & Attention
Modern NLP with state-of-the-art performance

## ✅ Transformers Basics
- Self-attention
- Encoder-Decoder architecture

## ✅ Hugging Face Transformers
- transformers library
- Pretrained models: BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, T5, GPT-2/3
- Tokenizers and Pipelines
- Fine-tuning for custom tasks

# 🧠 Phase 6: Applied NLP Tasks
Learn use-cases companies care about

## ✅ Key Projects
- Text classification (sentiment, topic)
- Named Entity Recognition (custom NER)
- Text summarization (extractive & abstractive)
- Question Answering
- Translation
- Semantic search (with embeddings)
- Chatbots & Conversational AI
- Document parsing (PDF to info extraction)

# ⚙️ Phase 7: Tools and Frameworks
Work like a pro
- Hugging Face Transformers + Datasets
- spaCy
- NLTK
- Gensim
- LangChain (for GenAI apps)
- LlamaIndex, ChromaDB
- MLflow (for experiment tracking)

# 🌍 Phase 8: Deployment & MLOps
- Ship real NLP systems
- REST APIs using FastAPI or Flask
- Streamlit for UI
- Containerisation (Docker)
- LLMOps concepts (RAG, vector DBs, prompt engineering)

# 📘 Recommended Projects (as you learn)
