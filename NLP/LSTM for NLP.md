# Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for NLP

When we deal with long texts, it becomes difficult for traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to remember context from earlier parts of the sequence while predicting the next word. This is known as the **vanishing gradient problem**.

However, **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks solve this issue by introducing memory cells that can retain information for long periods. LSTMs are a type of RNN specifically designed to handle long-term dependencies.

## Key Features of LSTM

- Maintains long-term memory through a special architecture involving gates: **input gate**, **forget gate**, and **output gate**.
- Can learn patterns in **both forward and backward** directions (when using Bidirectional LSTMs).
- Suitable for sequence prediction problems such as:
  - Text generation
  - Sentiment analysis
  - Machine translation
  - Speech recognition

## Why LSTM in NLP?

- Traditional RNNs struggle to carry context over long sequences.
- LSTMâ€™s memory cell structure allows it to preserve important context while forgetting irrelevant information.
- It helps in generating better context-aware representations for text, making it ideal for NLP tasks.
