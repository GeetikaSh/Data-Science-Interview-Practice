## Why do we need to study the Attention Mechanism, even though Encoder and Decoder work fine?
The Encoder-Decoder architecture works by compressing an input sequence into a single fixed-length context vector, which is then passed to the decoder to generate the output. 
While this method works reasonably well for short sentences, it struggles with longer or more complex sequences.

The main issue lies in the encoder's task of summarizing all the input information into a fixed-length representation. 
This creates a bottleneck, especially when dealing with lengthy sentences, as the encoder is forced to compress too much information into a single vector. 
This limitation can result in loss of critical details, affecting the performance of the model.

Additionally, the decoder relies entirely on this static representation (the context vector) to generate the output. 
For tasks like translation, this means the decoder cannot dynamically access specific parts of the input sequence, leading to inaccuracies, especially in longer texts.

The Attention Mechanism overcomes these challenges by allowing the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence at each decoding step. 
Instead of relying solely on a single context vector, the decoder dynamically computes a weighted combination of all encoder outputs. 
This enables the model to "attend" to the most relevant words in the input sequence based on the current decoding context, significantly improving performance in tasks like translation, summarization, and more.
