## Why do we need to study the Attention Mechanism, even though Encoder and Decoder work fine?
The Encoder-Decoder architecture works by compressing an input sequence into a single fixed-length context vector, which is then passed to the decoder to generate the output. 
While this method works reasonably well for short sentences, it struggles with longer or more complex sequences.

The main issue lies in the encoder's task of summarizing all the input information into a fixed-length representation. 
This creates a bottleneck, especially when dealing with lengthy sentences, as the encoder is forced to compress too much information into a single vector. 
This limitation can result in loss of critical details, affecting the performance of the model.

Additionally, the decoder relies entirely on this static representation (the context vector) to generate the output. 
For tasks like translation, this means the decoder cannot dynamically access specific parts of the input sequence, leading to inaccuracies, especially in longer texts.

The Attention Mechanism overcomes these challenges by allowing the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence at each decoding step. 
Instead of relying solely on a single context vector, the decoder dynamically computes a weighted combination of all encoder outputs. 
This enables the model to "attend" to the most relevant words in the input sequence based on the current decoding context, significantly improving performance in tasks like translation, summarization, and more.

## What is the Attention Mechanism in machine learning?
The attention mechanism is the concept inspired by the human conjetion, where the model selectively foccuses on certain part of the input while processing data.
It assigns varying levels of importace(weights) to different input element, allowing the model to priortise the most relevant feature for the specific task.
It is videly used in Natulal Language processing(NLP) and computer vision. 

## Why Attention Mechainsm introduced and what problem does it solve?
The Attention Mechnainsm was introduced to overcome the limitation of sequence model like RNNs, which strugles with long term dependencies and handelling variable-length efficiently.
Traditional seuence-to-sequence models ofthen compressed all information to a fixed-size vector(the bottleneck), leading to performance degradation for long sequences.
Attention allows the model to dynamically retrive relevant information from the input at each decoding step, improving context retentiona and output quality.

## Can you explain how the Attention Mechanism works in the context of sequence-to-sequence models?
In sequence-to-sequence models, attention works as follows:
**1. Encoder:** Processes the input sequence and generates hidden states for each time step.
**2. Attention Score:** Computes a score (similarity measure) between the decoder's current state and each encoder hidden state. Common methods include dot product, additive attention, or scaled dot product.
**3. Softmax:** Converts the scores into attention weights (probabilities).
**4. Context Vector:** Computes the weighted sum of the encoder hidden states, using the attention weights.
**5. Decoder:** Uses the context vecotor along with its own hidden state to generate the output.
This process is repeated at each decoding step, enabling the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence dynamically.

## What are the types of attention mechanism?
**1. Global Attention:** Considers all encoder hidden state while generating the context vector.
**2. Local Attention:** Focuses on a subset of encoder hiddden states near a specific point, reducing computional overhead.
**3. Self-Attention:** Computes attention within a single sequence( e.g. input sequence), where every token attends to every other token. This is widely used in Transformers.
**4. Multi-Head Attention:** Extends self-attention by using multiple attention heads to capture different relationships in data.

## How is the Attention Mechanism implemented in the Transformer model?
In Transformer the Attention Mechanism is implemnted through **Scaled Dot-Product Attention Mechanism**:
1. The input sequence is transformed into **queries (Q), keys (K), and values (V)** using learned weight matrices.
2. Attention Scores are computed as 
```math
\text{Scores} = \frac{Q K^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}
```
where $d_k$ is the dimetionality of the key vectors.\
3. The attention scores are passed through the softmax function to attain attention weights.\
4. The weighted sum of the values(V) is computed to produce the output.\
5. Multi-Head Attention combines outputs from multiple attention heads, enabling the model to focus on different aspects of the input simultaneously.
